                  The common interest that members of the Association share is to
                  inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
                  Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
                  whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
                  action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,

                      <span>DIMENSIONS.</span> IHF Law provides for flexible external
                      field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
                      length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used
                      by teams under 12 and older.

                    <li>
                      <span>COMPETITION FIELDS.</span> Fields used within the
                      competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues,
                      districts or associations participating in the state competition
                      program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                      minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which
                      will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                      recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                      dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                      associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                      required to play all their games away.

                        <li>
                          U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no
                          penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                          progressively larger.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards
                          width.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in
                          width.

                        <li>
                          In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their
                          internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified
